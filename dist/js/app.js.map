This wrapper holds altered versions of all the\n  // underscore functions. Wrapped objects may be chained.\n\n  // Helper function to continue chaining intermediate results.\n  var result = function(instance, obj) {\n    return instance._chain ? _(obj).chain() : obj;\n  };\n\n  // Add your own custom functions to the Underscore object.\n  _.mixin = function(obj) {\n    _.each(_.functions(obj), function(name) {\n      var func = _[name] = obj[name];\n      _.prototype[name] = function() {\n        var args = [this._wrapped];\n        push.apply(args, arguments);\n        return result(this, func.apply(_, args));\n      };\n    });\n  };\n\n  // Add all of the Underscore functions to the wrapper object.\n  _.mixin(_);\n\n  // Add all mutator Array functions to the wrapper.\n  _.each(['pop', 'push', 'reverse', 'shift', 'sort', 'splice', 'unshift'], function(name) {\n    var method = ArrayProto[name];\n    _.prototype[name] = function() {\n      var obj = this._wrapped;\n      method.apply(obj, arguments);\n      if ((name === 'shift' || name === 'splice') && obj.length === 0) delete obj[0];\n      return result(this, obj);\n    };\n  });\n\n  // Add all accessor Array functions to the wrapper.\n  _.each(['concat', 'join', 'slice'], function(name) {\n    var method = ArrayProto[name];\n    _.prototype[name] = function() {\n      return result(this, method.apply(this._wrapped, arguments));\n    };\n  });\n\n  // Extracts the result from a wrapped and chained object.\n  _.prototype.value = function() {\n    return this._wrapped;\n  };\n\n  // Provide unwrapping proxy for some methods used in engine operations\n  // such as arithmetic and JSON stringification.\n  _.prototype.valueOf = _.prototype.toJSON = _.prototype.value;\n\n  _.prototype.toString = function() {\n    return '' + this._wrapped;\n  };\n\n  // AMD registration happens at the end for compatibility with AMD loaders\n  // that may not enforce next-turn semantics on modules. Even though general\n  // practice for AMD registration is to be anonymous, underscore registers\n  // as a named module because, like jQuery, it is a base library that is\n  // popular enough to be bundled in a third party lib, but not be part of\n  // an AMD load request. Those cases could generate an error when an\n  // anonymous define() is called outside of a loader request.\n  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n    define('underscore', [], function() {\n      return _;\n    });\n  }\n}.call(this));\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/underscore/underscore.js\n// module id = 170\n// module chunks = 0","var g;\r\n\r\n// This works in non-strict mode\r\ng = (function() {\r\n\treturn this;\r\n})();\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n\t// This works if eval is allowed (see CSP)\r\n\tg = g || Function(\"return this\")() || (1,eval)(\"this\");\r\n} catch(e) {\r\n\t// This works if the window reference is available\r\n\tif(typeof window === \"object\")\r\n\t\tg = window;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// g can still be undefined, but nothing to do about it...\r\n// We return undefined, instead of nothing here, so it's\r\n// easier to handle this case. if(!global) { ...}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = g;\r\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// (webpack)/buildin/global.js\n// module id = 171\n// module chunks = 0","import React from 'react'\n\nexport const ToDoList = React.createClass({\n  getInitialState: function(){\n    return {\n      tasksToComplete: [],\n    }\n  },\n\n  _updateTasksList: function(taskName){\n    let copyOfItems = this.state.tasksToComplete.map(function(copy){return copy})\n      let copyOfItemsMinus = copyOfItems.filter(function(someStr){\n  \t\t\t\t\tif(taskName !== someStr){\n  \t\t\t\t\t\treturn true\n  \t\t\t\t\t} else {\n  \t\t\t\t\t\treturn false\n  \t\t\t\t\t}\n  \t\t\t\t})\n  \t\t\t\tthis.setState({\n  \t\t\t\t\ttasksToComplete: copyOfItemsMinus\n          })\n      },\n\n  _handleSubmit: function(evt){\n    evt.preventDefault()\n    let userTask = this.refs.taskInput.value\n    let copyOfItems = this.state.tasksToComplete.map(function(copy){return copy})\n    copyOfItems.push(userTask)\n     this.setState({\n       tasksToComplete : copyOfItems\n     })\n     this.refs.taskInput.value = ''\n  },\n\n render: function (){\n   console.log(this.state.tasksToComplete)\n   return(\n   <div className=\"container\">\n      <h1>Todo List</h1>\n      <div className=\"list-content\">\n        <form className=\"task-form\" onSubmit={this._handleSubmit}>\n          <input ref=\"taskInput\" type=\"text\" name=\"task\"/>\n          <button className=\"btn-submit\" type=\"submit\"><i className=\"fa fa-plus\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i></button>\n        </form>\n      <hr/>\n        <ToDoListItem\n         taskListArr={this.state.tasksToComplete}\n         _updateTasksListCB={this._updateTasksList}\n       />\n    </div>\n   </div>\n   )\n  }\n\n})\n\nconst ToDoListItem = React.createClass({\n  _createListItems: function(arrayOfTasks){\n    let component = this\n    let jsxComponents = arrayOfTasks.map(function(singleStr, i){\n      return (\n          <SingleItem key={i}\n          data = {singleStr}\n            _updateTasksListCB = {component.props._updateTasksListCB}\n          />\n        )\n        })\n        return jsxComponents\n    },\n\n  render: function(){\n    return(\n       <div className=\"page-body\">\n         {this._createListItems(this.props.taskListArr)}\n       </div>\n    )\n  }\n})\n\nconst SingleItem = React.createClass({\n\n    _handleDelete: function(){\n      let singleStr = this.props.data\n      this.props._updateTasksListCB(singleStr)\n    },\n\n    render: function(){\n      return (\n        <div className=\"single-task\">\n          <div className=\"btn-checkbox\">\n            <input type=\"checkbox\" value=\"None\" id=\"todo_checkbox\" name=\"check\"/>\n            <label for=\"todo_checkbox\"></label><span>{this.props.data}</span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"btn-delete\">\n            <i onClick={this._handleDelete} className=\"fa fa-times\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n})\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/scripts/ToDo.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
